# VIA Keyboards - CKBAD Edition
![Definitions](https://github.com/ckbad/keyboards/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This repository is a hard fork of https://github.com/the-via/keyboards

All non-broken keyboards have been removed, in lieu of hosting only definitions for Epomaker and other brands using some dinosaur old hard fork of QMK along with inane instructions to use VIA's developer mode to sideload their JSON files.

Since I don't want to deal with that nonsense every time I test a new keyboard, I'll do what they do- pick some old version of the software and stubbornly keep it limping along to the detriment of the entire community.
